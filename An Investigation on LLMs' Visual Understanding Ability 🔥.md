Really short on time currently but Luwam sparked my interest in this one again so I will come back to it, just got bigger fish to fry rn. This is no where near done tho, I might've gotten too deep into it. Maybe the entire history of computer vision is not needed....? 
# Intro

Computer vision is a fundamental component of artificial intelligence. Over the past several decades the field has undergone a significant transformation. Evolving from early rule-based systems that relied on handcrafted algorithms to modern deep learning.

With the rapid advancements in computational power in the recent decades AI’s visual perception now possess capabilities that even exceed human limitations in certain aspects, such as the ability to analyze vast quantities of visual data with speed and scale that is unparalleled.

In 1544, Gemma Frisius a mathematician and cartographer created a schematic drawing of the pinhole camera, this illustration captured the essence of perspective. This was the earliest representation of _camera obscura,_ it embodied the fundamental understanding of how light, when funneled through a small aperture, creates an inverted, scaled image.

Fast forward several centuries to the mid-20th century ,Larry Roberts, one of the most important and yet under-recognized figures in computer vision published “Machine Perception of Three-Dimensional Solids”. His work was incredibly significant but it is often overshadowed by modern advancements. In his 83 page paper he discusses extracting 3D information about objects from 2D photographs of line drawings.

So basically he would input the image using a facsmile scanner, not a fax machine. OR any other optical scanners for that matter and the object in the image could be broken down into geometric primitives like cubes wedges and it would be reconstructed using line drawings, this heavily influenced edge detection and shape recognition techniques which will be important later on. His work was the groundwork for later breakthroughs in image processing and it remains a crucial aspect of computer vision within robotics and scene analysis

In 1966 there was the ambitious MIT summer vision project which you might’ve heard of. Initiated by Seymour Papert and given to Gerald Sussman with a primary goal of utilizing summer students to construct a significant part of a visual system. Although this project didn’t achieve its ambitious goal within the summer timeframe, it signified the complexity of the task even more as early on researchers had recognized the importance and complexity of identifying objects and their context within an image, and the Summer Vision Project was an initial attempt to adress this.

In 1967
