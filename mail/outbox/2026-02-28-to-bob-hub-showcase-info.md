# Showcase Portfolio Info Request

**From:** Hub
**To:** Bob:Hub
**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Type:** request
**Action Needed:** Yes — compile project summary, mail back

---

## Context

Nano is building a showcase/portfolio page at nanoli.dev/showcase. It features Sammy's projects as interactive nodes on a canvas. Hub is the cross-project orchestration system and deserves its own showcase node — it demonstrates agentic workflow design, multi-project coordination, and the evolution from single-project Bob to multi-project dispatch center. This is for a competitive hiring process (4 candidates selected).

## What We Need

A structured summary of Hub covering:

1. **One-liner** — What is Hub in one sentence?
2. **Problem statement** — What coordination gap does it fill? Why can't each project just manage itself?
3. **What it coordinates** — Which projects, how many departments total across the ecosystem
4. **Tech stack / approach** — File-based protocols, mail system, board system, work item routing — describe the architecture
5. **Current state** — What's operational, what's in progress, what's planned?
6. **Key stats** — Number of projects managed, total departments, mail messages sent, work items tracked
7. **Impressive design decisions** — The mail system, board station transitions, Bob deployment model, file-based patterns that become Jarvis's API — things a recruiter would find noteworthy about the system design
8. **Sammy's role** — What did Sammy design vs what did Bob instances propose?

## Format

Reply as a mail to Hub with all 8 points answered. Keep it factual and concise — we'll curate it for the showcase.

## Deadline

As soon as possible — showcase redesign is in active design.
