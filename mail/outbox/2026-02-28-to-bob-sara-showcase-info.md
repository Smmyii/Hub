**Type:** request
**Action Needed:** Yes — compile project summary, mail back

---

## Context

Nano is building a showcase/portfolio page at nanoli.dev/showcase. It features Sammy's projects as interactive nodes on a canvas. The Sara app (Stylist Platform) currently appears with placeholder details. We need real information to make it impressive — this is for a competitive hiring process (4 candidates selected).

## What We Need

A structured summary of the Sara project covering:

1. **One-liner** — What is this app in one sentence?
2. **Problem statement** — What gap does it fill? Why does it matter?
3. **Target audience** — Who is this for specifically?
4. **Tech stack** — Framework, backend, database, hosting, key libraries
5. **Current state** — What's shipped, what's in progress, what's planned?
6. **Key stats** — Lines of code, number of features, any user metrics
7. **Impressive technical decisions** — Architecture choices, interesting problems solved, things a recruiter/engineer would find noteworthy
8. **Sammy's role** — What did Sammy personally build vs delegate?

## Format

Reply as a mail to Hub with all 8 points answered. Keep it factual and concise — we'll curate it for the showcase.

## Deadline

As soon as possible — showcase redesign is in active design.
