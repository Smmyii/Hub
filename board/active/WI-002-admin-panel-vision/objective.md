# WI-002: Admin Panel Vision & Scoping

**Project:** Kompisapp
**Origin:** Hub session 2026-02-26
**Priority:** Medium
**Size:** Research only (1 session)

## What
Research and scope what the Kompisapp Admin panel should become. The current panel is bare-bones CRUD — it needs a vision for growth.

## Why
Sammy expects the Admin panel to grow into something significantly better. Before planning any work, Bob needs to research what would be most valuable and produce a scoped proposal.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research document covering: what exists today, what's missing, what similar apps offer, what would serve Kompisapp's content pipeline best
- [ ] Prioritized feature list with rationale
- [ ] Proposed phasing (what to build first, what can wait)
- [ ] Mail to Hub with findings and recommendation

## Constraints
- Research only — no code, no planning yet
- Consider the current stack (tRPC, Supabase, Expo Router) — proposals should be buildable
- Admin panel serves content creators (Sammy + potentially others later)
