notes: |
  Bob:Nano is the OG — first Bob, most mature. Patterns established here
  become the template for all future Bobs. Currently migrating from
  BOB-HANDOFF.md to the layered bob/ context structure.

  Most common task: updating planning docs after decisions (~60% of activity).
  The station model captures execution flow but Bob's day-to-day is mostly
  decision → update INTEGRATION.md → update CLAUDE.md → update handoff docs.
